# 🎭 Real Time Emotion Detection System (FER2013)

## 📌 Project Overview
Traditional digital learning platforms track clicks, time-on-task, and completion rates, but completely ignore emotional engagement. This project addresses that blind spot by building an AI-powered facial emotion recognition system that detects learner emotions in real time using webcam input.

The system classifies facial expressions into seven core emotions and provides live analytics, enabling emotion-aware interventions in online learning environments.

This repository contains the complete end-to-end pipeline: data preparation, model training, evaluation, and real-time deployment.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Current e-learning platforms fail because they:

- Cannot detect confusion or frustration
- Miss boredom and disengagement
- Ignore positive or negative emotional reactions
- Fail to notice attention drops, leading to higher dropout rates

### Bottom line: Learning systems are emotionally blind.

## 💡 Proposed Solution
### An AI-driven facial emotion recognition engine that:

- Analyzes real-time webcam video
- Converts facial expressions into actionable emotional insights
- Enables immediate pedagogical intervention
- Closes the emotional feedback loop to improve retention

Pipeline:
### Webcam Input → CNN-based Emotion Model → Live Analytics Dashboard

## 😉 Supported Emotion Classes
- Angry
- Disgust
- Fear
- Happy
- Neutral
- Sad
- Surprise

## ⚙️ Technical Approach
### Core Technologies
- Facial Landmark Detection for feature extraction
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for emotion classification
- TensorFlow / PyTorch for deep learning workflows
  
`` Reality check: Facial recognition is not emotion detection.
  Emotion detection depends on facial recognition, but they are not the same problem. ``

## 📊 Dataset
### Source
- FER2013 Dataset (Kaggle)
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013

### Dataset Statistics
| Emotion  | Images |
| -------- | ------ |
| Angry    | 3,995  |
| Disgust  | 436    |
| Fear     | 4,097  |
| Happy    | 7,215  |
| Sad      | 4,830  |
| Surprise | 3,171  |
| Neutral  | 4,965  |

- Training set: 28,709 images
- Test set: 7,178 images
- Total: 35,887 images

## ⚠️ Data Quality Issues Identified
These are real limitations, not academic excuses:
- ~15% low-quality samples (blur, occlusion, poor lighting)
- ~8% near-duplicate images
- High label inconsistency (ambiguous expressions)
- Distribution imbalance (underrepresented emotions like disgust & fear)
Ignoring these issues would invalidate results. They were explicitly audited and handled.

## 🧹 Data Preparation
### Preprocessing Pipeline
- Image normalization & resizing
- Label standardization
- Dataset structure unification
- Version-controlled preprocessing steps
### Drift Handling
#### Problem:
New data introduced variations in lighting, pose, camera quality, and demographics → silent accuracy degradation.
#### Solution:
- Automated input drift detection
- Emotion distribution monitoring
- Label consistency checks
- Retraining triggers when thresholds are exceeded

## 🧠 Model Training
### Training Details
- Architecture: CNN
- Epochs: 50
- Training Time: ~3.45 hours (GPU)
- Best Epoch: 38

### Achieved Performance
- Validation Accuracy: 69.23%
- Validation Loss: 0.8234

FER2013 benchmark reality:
  - Human performance: ~65%
  - Strong academic models: 65–70%
  - State-of-the-art ceiling: ~73%
This model is competitive, not magical.

## 🧪 Evaluation
Evaluation includes:
- Classification report (precision, recall, F1)
- Confusion matrix
- Training & validation loss curves
- Per-class performance breakdown
#### Target threshold: >60% test accuracy
#### Achieved: ~65–70%
